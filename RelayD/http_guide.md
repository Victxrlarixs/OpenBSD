# Intro

```
My website automatically redirects users from http to https and this gets achieved using a simple 
redirection in /etc/httpd.conf So if you have a configuration similar to mine, then you will still 
want to have httpd listenon the egress interface on port 80. The key thing to change here is to have
httpd listen on 127.0.0.1 on port 443.

        listen on egress port 80
        alias "www.example.com"
        block return 302 "https://$SERVER_NAME$REQUEST_URI"

                sack
                backlog 10

        tls {
                certificate "/etc/ssl/example.com.crt"
                key "/etc/ssl/private/example.com.key"
        }
}

The key thing to note here, again, is that example.com is also listening on the localhost on port 443. 
This is necessary to maintain the Strict Transport Security integrity intact. Failing to do this may 
result in some unintended consequences like parts of your website not rendering correctly. 
Also, Iâ€™ve changed the style of logging to forwarded so that I can see the actual IP address of the client. 
The next step is creating the configuration file for /etc/relayd.conf. 
I also want to be able to support IPv6 because traffic on IPv6 is only going to increase.

From here it is simply a matter of enabling and starting relayd and reloading the configuration for httpd. 
Once you do this, check your website at securityheaders.com. This setting will give you an A score. 
The only thing I have yet to figure out is the Content Security Policy header.
